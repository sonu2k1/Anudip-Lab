    <h1>Sonu Singh</h1>
    <p>"First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity. Myself Sonu Singh. I have recently completed my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from ITS Engineering College, Greater Noida, with a CGPA of 8.03.

I focus on frontend development and have worked with technologies like React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI. During my internship at Vedalytics Solutions, I improved the website’s performance and built better UI components. I’m also working as a freelancer on a project called 'LETME Handle', where I’m creating responsive and user-friendly pages.

Along with academics, I was also actively involved in extra-curricular activities. I was the Class Representative throughout my B.Tech, where I helped manage communication between faculty and students. I also helped in organizing and handling events during college functions and tech fests. These responsibilities improved my leadership, coordination, and communication skills.

I enjoy building clean, responsive websites and I’m always eager to learn new things and grow as a frontend developer."</p>
